My task was to:
  1. Implement Merge Sort.
  2. Add ability to run script from cmd typing such command "**python merge_sort.py asc/desc arguments (seperated by comma)**".
  3. Add report after sorting.
  4. Write tests that cover different cases such as sorting an already sorted array.

To run script:
  1. Make sure You have python installed
  2. Download or clone repo.
  3. Navigate to that folder.
  4. Open cmd in that folder.
  5. Type "**python merge_sort.py asc/desc arguments (seperated by comma)**"

To run tests:
  1. Make sure You have coverage module installed ("**pip install coverage**")
  2. Navigate to folded with repo.
  3. Type "**python test_main.py**"
